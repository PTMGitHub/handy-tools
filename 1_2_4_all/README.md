# 1, 2, 4, all pair organiser.

This programme is designed to quickly organise a list of names to use in the 1, 2, 4, all tool.

It produces a tree diagram PDF showing:

1. pairs, and then 
2. combined pairs

Providing `office` or `remote` along with the names so the programme will match like with like to make running the 
1,2,4, all easier to run.

It will produce both an Office and Remote diagram PDF.
